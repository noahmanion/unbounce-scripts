## Unbounce Scripts!
I created this libary of CSS and JS files that I oftentimes use on Unbounce landing pages. For the most part they either extend features or give functionality that Unbounce doesn't offer out of the box with their page builder. For the most part, the scripts refernce CSS selectors of elements on spefific pages. They're also organized here for use in my portfolio that you can find at https://noahs.website

The scripts are:
- checkboxes_radios_as_buttons.css -> styles checkboxes & radio buttons on forms to look like buttons.
- conversational.js -> creates a conversational style form. I didn't create this and honestly think it's weird. 
- cookie.js -> creates a cookie on form submit. I don't think I created this one either.
- field_gating.js -> Shows hidden portions of forms based on selections on a dropdown field.
- multiformv3-1.js & multiformv3-2.js -> creates multi step forms. Didn't really create this one either.
- ouibounce-cookie.js -> an extension of the cookie script that uses Ouibounce to show an exit intent modal.
- quiz-unbonce.js -> creates a version of a quiz from my [Quizengine repo](https://github.com/noahmanion/quizengine).
